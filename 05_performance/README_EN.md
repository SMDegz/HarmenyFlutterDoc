## Environment Configurations

If **http_proxy** and **https_proxy** are set in the environment variables, **no_proxy** should also be set.

```
export no_proxy=::1,127.0.0.1,localhost
```

You can execute the `flutter doctor -v` instruction to check whether the Flutter development environment is properly configured.
